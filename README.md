### Setup Instructions

2. Add the following line to the `local.properties` file, replacing `<gemini_api_key>` with your Gemini API key:

    ```properties
    apiKey=<gemini_api_key>
    ```

3. Save the `local.properties` file.

### System Requirements

- Android Studio (latest version recommended)
